# AI Traffic Management System

A comprehensive web application for AI-powered traffic management using YOLO vehicle detection and intelligent signal optimization. The system analyzes traffic patterns from images, videos, and live webcam feeds to provide real-time signal recommendations.

## Features

### Vehicle Detection & Analysis
- **YOLO-powered AI detection** - Identifies and classifies vehicles in real-time
- **Multi-lane detection** - Automatically detects 2-4 traffic lanes
- **Vehicle classification** - Recognizes cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bicycles
- **Confidence scoring** - Each detection includes confidence level

### Input Methods
- **Image Upload** - Analyze static traffic images (JPG, PNG, GIF)
- **Video Upload** - Process traffic videos (MP4, AVI, MOV)
- **Live Webcam** - Real-time analysis from webcam feed

### Traffic Signal Optimization
- **Intelligent recommendations** - Suggests which signal should be green
- **Congestion assessment** - Evaluates traffic density (low/medium/high)
- **Priority scoring** - Calculates lane priority based on vehicle count and congestion
- **Optimization metrics** - Provides traffic flow efficiency scores

### Data & Analytics
- **Historical tracking** - Stores all analyses in Supabase database
- **Real-time dashboard** - Visual metrics and statistics
- **Vehicle distribution** - Breakdown by vehicle type
- **Lane-by-lane analysis** - Detailed per-lane traffic data
- **Processing metrics** - Analysis time and performance tracking

```bash
npm install
```

3. Environment variables are pre-configured in `.env`:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized production build will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Running Type Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Upload File Analysis
1. Click the "Upload File" tab
2. Drag and drop an image or video, or click to browse
3. Wait for analysis to complete (1-2 seconds)
4. View results including:
   - Total vehicle count
   - Lane detection
   - Vehicle type distribution
   - Signal recommendation
   - Congestion levels per lane

### 2. Live Webcam Analysis
1. Click the "Live Webcam" tab
2. Click "Start Webcam" (grant camera permissions)
3. Position camera to capture traffic
4. Click "Analyze Frame" to process current view
5. Review real-time traffic analysis

### 3. View History
1. Click the "History" tab to see past analyses
2. Click any historical entry to view full details
3. Delete unwanted entries with the trash icon

## Database Schema

### traffic_analyses
Stores completed traffic analyses with:
- Input type (image/video/webcam)

## Security

### Database Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Authenticated users can view all analyses
- Users can only modify/delete their own data
- No direct database access from frontend

## Troubleshooting

### Webcam not working
- Ensure browser has camera permissions
- Check if another application is using the camera
- Try a different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)

### Analysis failing
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase connection in `.env`
- Ensure Edge Function is deployed
- Check image/video file format

### Slow performance
- Reduce image/video resolution
- Check internet connection speed
- Clear browser cache
- Use Chrome for best performance
